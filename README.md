## All code related to AWS.

There is some code here which I have copied from various sources. All that is provided on an AS-IS basis. Please don't reach out to me for help or questions. I can't help. For items that I have created and I will have labeled (or at least tried to) clearly, please feel free to reachout.

I try to publish my latest work on my website at https://www.dharwadkar.com
